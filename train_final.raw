Bases can't link to one another. This restriction really holds back possibilities, like, say, a single CRM base (with customers, tasks, etc.) that's SHARED by any/all other bases

No offline support whatsoever. Cannot even VIEW without a connection. Bummer.

It's tedious (and/or privacy-invading) to add pics/attachments. I don't want to share my entire iCloud photo library. I DO want to simply copy/paste into attachment fields!

$T$ menu? Also would be handy to add images, or anything, from other apps to bases via iOS share menu

Collapsible editable groupings of fields (in form view and/or table view) would be FANTASTIC to reduce scrolling and organize 

Vertical scrolling to navigate between records is a huge hassle when there are many fields.

FEATURE REQUEST: Please add support for $T$ view on iOS and iPadOS. A number of the projects on which I work include the approval of images for use in various projects. $T$ view is a must for these types of projects, so I can easily view the images.

Plus, if $T$ view was enabled on iOS and iPadOS, I would undoubtedly upload more images to AirTable, decreasing my free storage and requiring me to upgrade my account - which I would be happily do, by the way 😉

It’s easily customisable and replaces my reliance on a spreadsheet to maintain my inventory. The only issue is that the app is so limited. I can’t duplicate a record which is frustrating when I purchase 20 different things from the same supplier on the same date etc. This means I have to either duplicate the record on a desktop (in which case, why use the app) or I have to manually enter the same information 20 times. This is incredibly frustrating.

Another gripe I have is that I can’t customise the first column in the base or freeze the first two columns. A picture is very important for my inventory and I need to either customise the first column to allow addition of a picture as or freeze the first two columns so that when i scroll across, I can relate the information to the exact item. $T$ columns is available on the desktop version but not the app which means that when I’m out and about, I have to constantly scroll back and forth.

There are other limitations in the app such as the inability to select multiple records to delete/copy or the lack of gallery/calendar/kanban view, but those aren’t as exasperating for me as the previous two I mentioned. It’s a shame because desktop version of Airtable is an incredible tool and so versatile while the iOS app is so restricted. If we were talking about the desktop version I’d give it 5 stars but for now, the iOS app only gets 3.Freezing1Airtable is great because, it is simple to use with its $T$ format, and it actually works on many devices - even those with older OSs - iOS 8 being one (That's amazing!sheet2Good thing to supervise and support $T$.projects1did not work well but seems to be smooth and working, very please with the fix will use this $T$ now thank you to the developers.app0guys for many types of pages I am $T$ it would be vastly preferable to force dark mode.sharing1hi, i would like to point out that it takes really long time to $T$ and download my video.export0+ aesthetic $T$ text + tiled header (more r.database2as i said my vat number is already $T$ on the page in question.listed1As a small $T$ owner with 4 kids and a dose of ADDbusiness1before time delivery, prompt $T$ on last minute orders..kudosservice2but anytime i try to start the video $T$ an error pops uptrimmer0the desktop app for mac is great though.Mac2a very nice app for those who wants to $T$ all of their stuff into one space and make it creative.organize2really nice notes $T$ this is the most complex notes app i have ever seenapp,2this is not a video from a template i want to trimTEMPLATE1availablity of stock, $T$ cancellation should be avoideddelivery of products,0can you refund the $T$ subscription for notion i have.annual1right i will delete the file then and redo in an $T$ windowincognito1automated text to speech.Text2iam looking for after effect in video $T$editing1very hard to $T$ the video, because the video always hang, especialy the big file video or 4-6 minute length videotrim0Sadly it is not possible to alter column widths on a $T$ device which therefore renders the application totally useless.mobile0the best productivity $T$app2, notion team notion.so, the all-in-one workspace for your $T$ tasks, wikis, and databases.notes,2It is used for managing various tasks in a $T$.group1the fruits and $T$ are of poor quality.. also, the fruits and $T$ are damp inside the cover.veges0my $T$ says premium instead of unlimitedplan0and i just $T$ it, no differencereset1every change i made does not get $T$saved?0servoce charge as per no of $T$ made and not as per no of products.deliveries0i spent 2 hours $T$ my @notionhq notes.organizing1they may as well wrap the website because it is literally faster and more usable than this $T$app.0i agree that this is an overwhelming $T$ at first, but stick with it.app2reinstalled three times.Reinstalled2deleted media from $T$computer0please enable multi-column layout on the ipad, drag and $T$ text editing, at part with the desktop counterpart.drop,0you charge a huge amount of one needs $T$ or bread.eggs0anyway emails is  and the team plan we are talking about is for starpro $T$workspace.1prompt $T$ kn time deliveryservice,2please $T$ items and ensure that they are not damaged.deliver correct0so this app has actually $T$ me less productive.made0notion will not open anymore.Notion0vegetables were of very poor $T$ it was completely rotten.quality,0but not in the $T$ version.desktop1Use this to keep me and my $T$ organized and I love it!colleagues2i $T$d the app and redownloaded it but it still continued to crash.delete0i thought that i already canceled my $T$subscription0great $T$ but has major flaw that can cover all the benefits why this awesome $T$ has crashes on startupapp2feature request:add oled $T$dark mode0yes, i have a small logo in all the scenes i just noticed and need to $T$ itremove1I have been $T$ for this service for months after we cancelled during the trial!

You can’t even create formula fields on mobile. Drag and dropping photos on iPad from other apps to records also doesn't seem to exist.

How would people get anything done if they were strictly limited to the most updated devices?).

Also, it doesn't seem to be specifically built into the app, but there seems to be a way to do offline, as long as the base you want to view is left open before you go offline and viewing is all you need.

Suggestions:
- Ability to change checkbox status without having to open the specific record.

- The ability to export certain records. Let's say you have an active filter and you want to export just the ones you're viewing.

I’ve rated the app 3 stars for 2 reasons:

No gallery view in app
-the ability to switch between views is the main reason we use Airtable instead of excel. Having an app version (that has a zoom option) would make this a 4 star app. 

No offline viewing mode
- the collaborative nature of this program is amazing. I realize solving discrepancies is the main reason for not having an offline mode. However, We use this mainly for a visual representation of our products. If we are in a building with bad signal or traveling overseas, it would be ideal to at least have a “last saved version” to reference photos offline. $T$ viewing mode would make this a 5 star app.

I will immediately revise this review if gallery view is added to the app and if an offline viewing mode is added.

Everything requires numerous bolt on integrations that cost our company an extra $175/month. 

The $T$ integration helps a ton. However it’s missing several vital triggers. Like detecting an updated record. Thus the workaround is a $49/per month patch “plug in” by a 3rd party. 

$T$ claims they have been requesting this of Airtable to enable this for many many months. 

Come on Airtable. Please don’t make us pay hundreds of dollars more per month to enable features that Airtable could certainly provide. 

Another missing function (which would not require a zap), allowing customers to update their own record requires a 3rd party integration to simply create a unique url to a unique form for external updating. Airtable developers could flip a switch to get these “BASICS” enabled.Zapier1sure, ill mail the lifetime $T$ offer directly from  - but you can get back on itplan2I'm $T$, but it was very useful and intuitive.learning1i recommend doing most of your editing on the computer $T$, and using your phone $T$ for things like checking your planner.app2having the $T$ for a call log in those busy times has been incredibly helpful in keeping on top of calls and jobs.notion app2only a few suggestions: please make the $T$ faster and please make the offline working experience better.apps2exelent app, it has helped me get all of my $T$ and ideas in place.notes2hi, thamirys sorry about this, we just updated to the latest version of katex to add support for more amsthm environments that might affect some structure including the $T$.color0by keeping $T$ and keeping away the short fall of stocksadequate stocks0i freaking love this $T$app.2need to improve with promised $T$ as it is being so much delayed nowadaysdelivery time0Need to be able to make a task public from a $T$, as of right now you can only make it public from a desktop and mine is down for a bit.phone1i want to $T$ and request a refund.cancel1you have mentioned that it is not the $T$ that you want to be undeleted, but a page, right?workspace1i love this $T$app.2@notionhq would be the perfect note-taking + $T$ management tool if performance/speed was improved.project2hi i would like to cancel my $T$ pleasesubscription0i uv received rotten vegetables and $T$ and stale bread.fruits0i wasted 3 pkts of $T$milk0The program is excellent for managing individual and team $T$.projects1if i could give you seventeen stars i would because this $T$ is amazingtool2it is 100% customizable for whatever your needs are, there are so many options of views, templates, tags, $T$ tables, lists and other elements that are so useful for so many things i can not even list here.menus,2Great app for $T$ and business planning and managementpersonal1i really love notion but buggy $T$ is a major set back for me.android app0it is best productivity $T$ i have ever use and definitely recommend it.app2can you once try on some other $T$ like firefox or edge?browser1i may still do an $T$ at some point, but yes thought this was a nice.integration1you will only able to see a $T$ page on your $T$ notion pages once you are on a team plan and the person who is the owner of the page is also a member of the team plan.shared1so, i see fit with $T$ does have some black bar, what we can do here is just add a shape and color it while then set it behindblur0so, if i do not want a $T$, i can remove it from the brand presets, correct?logo0we are sorry that you are facing these issues and would like to recommend trying again on an $T$ google chrome window.incognito1please cancel the $T$ and let me know,plan0the $T$ is wonderful.app2and currently i am on a basic $T$plan1for notetaking, let us just go back to normal $T$onenote/evernote.0It’s very easy to $T$ once you pick it up.navigate2no response on the issues that supr daily team does not want to resolve.Supr daily0we have refunded your payment and $T$led your subscription.cancel1after update for my miezu mx6 - $T$ do not starred.app0as an example, my experience with tomatoes and $T$ was not satisfactory and inspite of free delivery, i did not think to order further items.mosambi0wonderful $T$ which makes me keep track of my thesis work.app2note taking make easy and fantabulousNote taking2at least for my moto g 1st (android 5.1), it took so long to load the data compare to other to do list (clickup and to-do).(ClickUp and To-Do).0we want to understand it the $T$ gantt view can be used for such projects/tasks to replace the use of ms project.timeline2delivery fee and membership fee are high.Delivery0I don't understand how to track time in a $T$ app?mobile1The app is much less interesting and comfortable to use than the $T$, too bad.web version1features access to 3500+ curated templates full access to image library full access to standard video library 120 istock $T$ and videos free access to creator club's (premium) templatesimages2i received simla mitch but one piece is spoiled.received Simla0Great day of $T$.working together2some days we receive $T$ or no delivery at allpartial delivery0Asana help me to organize my marketing ideas all together and able to $T$ to my marketing team instantly in a macro view.assign task1simple interface, easy to use.Interface,2the problem here is that, when offline, the app is unusable: no $T$ no emojis.images,0I have been using for a few weeks now the app n free version which is wonderful, I think soon to switch to premium to benefit from multi-$T$ planning and timeline.

Can't just add up a column without creating additional tables.   $T$.   And then the videos they have on their web site.    Seriously - how about a way of freezing the video so we can follow the steps.    Watched one video; I had to watch it 20 times at least so I could follow the steps.   

I know, it's not supposed to be excel.   I get it.   Still too complicated to just add up how much I am supposed to be reimbursed for my mileage, parking etc.    

But hey,  not all bad - I haven't torn out all my hair - yet.

SMEAC
• Situation 
• Mission 
• Execution (of the mission, not your team… since no one would be left to make you coffee ☕️‼️)
• Administration 
• $T$ 

I’m able to use exactly the same with Asana and get the same results in my business. Quickly, efficiently and as part of a team (without any blood stains or missing persons reporting).

I have 259 different apps between my iPhone and iPad. If I could only keep 3; 
• Notability
• Asana 
• My car key would be it (It would just be too expensive smashing the window every time I needed in the car).

I hope you guys have won awards! 🏆 You have certainly deserved it.

Bravo‼️

I say this not so that everyone reaches out or get frustrated if you don’t get the response I did, but to point out how important this company is to the people who created this. And it was done so knowing that the user is what will help catapult the company forward by doing exactly what they have done, create an amazing product and ensuring it runs very smooth.
