Here's what's wrong...

Bases can't link to one another. This restriction really holds back possibilities, like, say, a single CRM base (with customers, tasks, etc.) that's SHARED by any/all other bases

No offline support whatsoever. Cannot even VIEW without a connection. Bummer.

It's tedious (and/or privacy-invading) to add pics/attachments. I don't want to share my entire iCloud photo library. I DO want to simply copy/paste into attachment fields!

Share menu? Also would be handy to add images, or anything, from other apps to bases via iOS share menu

Collapsible editable groupings of fields (in form view and/or table view) would be FANTASTIC to reduce scrolling and organize 

Vertical scrolling to navigate between records is a huge hassle when there are many fields. PLEASE add next/previous buttons or allow swiping sideways to navigate between records (at least as an option in settings.)Share1I'm torn on the phone version of the app.phone version1i was focused on buying the $ 10 planplan1is it anywhere on your roadmap atm?roadmap1its take too much time to open.Its2Finally got an email to set up my account, new review pending.email1got a problem adding images from istock.istock1Have not paid a dime for this app and it has completely changed how I run my business.paid2missed delivery of items multiple times, but seem to have improved in last few daysdelivery0i am transfering all my business stuff over to a new bank .business1please continue to work on the mobile app.app.2This app never opens for me.app never opens0Very bad UI in app on tablet.tablet0prompt delivery and availability of products.availability of products.2you should not be charge rs2 as delivery charge for milk when we pay money in advance.delivery charge0stop canceling order and saying not available when the item is available on your site.ORDER0so what stays in notion can never be taken out using mobile app.mobile app.0and the dark mode needs a black theme ( appearance) , the dark mode is grey which makes it unattractive .dark mode0Can’t create new account nor using google account.account1flexibility and on time delivery.delivery.2I just discovered that airtable isnt available for offline use.offline0i love notion but it is disappointing to see that the mobile app no longer supports android 6.0.1.notion2but if i put "none" as animation it will still slide from left to right!slide0reduce delivery/ service charges .service charges0I am asking about the option in invideo to share with twit, i already has account but what is process in ur plateformshare1delivery time, app features for vacation, door bell, product varietyDelivery2please do not hesitate to drop us a line again whenever you need help.drop2syncs across devices, notes can be shared easily as.Syncs2incredible slow start up, it is useless if i have to wait so muchslow start0i wanted to see if there is an issue with the credit card function.credit1_ nope, that is a dated wordpress theme site for my movie + tv motion design workdesign0App is slow and freezes alot during use.slow0hi i want to download the video i made after i put my carddownload1reduce lag while typing significantly 3.lag0service fee you are taking that is fine but cancelling few orders items that tok in city like hyderabad is a mess .Service fee0i am unable to copy text from notion and paste is somewhere else.paste0punctuality, genuine products, mrp ratesMRP rates2but if a cancel i can not reach customer supportcustomer support0you must abolish delivery charges immediatelydelivery charges0this app has massively improved in the past year and the pc version is a god-send!PC version2vegetable price must be reducedVegetable0Missing grouping, inline URLs in long text and many other features as others have pointed out.

AirTable as our project bible. We can work on complex projects without having to worry about who’s completed what or what still needs done. It’s all there in AirTable. AirTable is an incredibly powerful tool. I also use it to inventory my personal music collection. Love it! 

FEATURE REQUEST: Please add support for Gallery view on iOS and iPadOS. A number of the projects on which I work include the approval of images for use in various projects. Gallery view is a must for these types of projects, so I can easily view the images. I currently have to use another program for image-approval projects. I would much rather use AirTable for everything. Plus, if Gallery view was enabled on iOS and iPadOS, I would undoubtedly upload more images to AirTable, decreasing my free storage and requiring me to upgrade my account - which I would be happily do, by the way 😉

It’s easily customisable and replaces my reliance on a spreadsheet to maintain my inventory. The only issue is that the app is so limited. I can’t duplicate a record which is frustrating when I purchase 20 different things from the same supplier on the same date etc. This means I have to either duplicate the record on a desktop (in which case, why use the app) or I have to manually enter the same information 20 times. This is incredibly frustrating.

Another gripe I have is that I can’t customise the first column in the base or freeze the first two columns. A picture is very important for my inventory and I need to either customise the first column to allow addition of a picture as or freeze the first two columns so that when i scroll across, I can relate the information to the exact item. Freezing columns is available on the desktop version but not the app which means that when I’m out and about, I have to constantly scroll back and forth.

There are other limitations in the app such as the inability to select multiple records to delete/copy or the lack of gallery/calendar/kanban view, but those aren’t as exasperating for me as the previous two I mentioned. It’s a shame because desktop version of Airtable is an incredible tool and so versatile while the iOS app is so restricted. If we were talking about the desktop version I’d give it 5 stars but for now, the iOS app only gets 3.Freezing1Airtable is great because, it is simple to use with its sheet format, and it actually works on many devices - even those with older OSs - iOS 8 being one (That's amazing!sheet2Good thing to supervise and support projects.projects1did not work well but seems to be smooth and working, very please with the fix will use this app now thank you to the developers.app0guys for many types of pages I am sharing it would be vastly preferable to force dark mode.sharing1hi, i would like to point out that it takes really long time to export and download my video.export0+ aesthetic database text + tiled header (more r.database2as i said my vat number is already listed on the page in question.listed1As a small business owner with 4 kids and a dose of ADDbusiness1before time delivery, prompt service on last minute orders..kudosservice2but anytime i try to start the video trimmer an error pops uptrimmer0the desktop app for mac is great though.Mac2a very nice app for those who wants to organize all of their stuff into one space and make it creative.organize2really nice notes app, this is the most complex notes app i have ever seenapp,2this is not a video from a template i want to trimTEMPLATE1availablity of stock, delivery of products, cancellation should be avoideddelivery of products,0can you refund the annual subscription for notion i have.annual1right i will delete the file then and redo in an incognito windowincognito1automated text to speech.Text2iam looking for after effect in video editingediting1very hard to trim the video, because the video always hang, especialy the big file video or 4-6 minute length videotrim0Sadly it is not possible to alter column widths on a mobile device which therefore renders the application totally useless.mobile0the best productivity appapp2, notion team notion.so, the all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.notes,2It is used for managing various tasks in a group.group1the fruits and veges are of poor quality.. also, the fruits and veges are damp inside the cover.veges0my plan says premium instead of unlimitedplan0and i just reset it, no differencereset1every change i made does not get saved?saved?0servoce charge as per no of deliveries made and not as per no of products.deliveries0i spent 2 hours organizing my @notionhq notes.organizing1they may as well wrap the website because it is literally faster and more usable than this app.app.0i agree that this is an overwhelming app at first, but stick with it.app2reinstalled three times.Reinstalled2deleted media from computercomputer0please enable multi-column layout on the ipad, drag and drop, text editing, at part with the desktop counterpart.drop,0you charge a huge amount of one needs eggs or bread.eggs0anyway emails is  and the team plan we are talking about is for starpro workspace.workspace.1prompt service, kn time deliveryservice,2please deliver correct items and ensure that they are not damaged.deliver correct0so this app has actually made me less productive.made0notion will not open anymore.Notion0vegetables were of very poor quality, it was completely rotten.quality,0but not in the desktop version.desktop1Use this to keep me and my colleagues organized and I love it!colleagues2i deleted the app and redownloaded it but it still continued to crash.delete0i thought that i already canceled my subscriptionsubscription0great app but has major flaw that can cover all the benefits why this awesome app has crashes on startupapp2feature request:add oled dark modedark mode0yes, i have a small logo in all the scenes i just noticed and need to remove itremove1I have been billed for this service for months after we cancelled during the trial!

Thought I’d try Airtable as an alternative to Notion, but quickly found its features very limited compared with what’s advertised on their web sites front page.  The lack of Kanban board views is an instant killer for me. File uploads also seem to get stuck and never finish if I tap the image icon, but works if I tap the 3 dots!  You can’t even create formula fields on mobile. Drag and dropping photos on iPad from other apps to records also doesn't seem to exist.

How would people get anything done if they were strictly limited to the most updated devices?).

Also, it doesn't seem to be specifically built into the app, but there seems to be a way to do offline, as long as the base you want to view is left open before you go offline and viewing is all you need.

Suggestions:
- Ability to change checkbox status without having to open the specific record.

- The ability to export certain records. Let's say you have an active filter and you want to export just the ones you're viewing.

- Form view for mobile.Form view1sure, i can share a link to pay, do you prefer paying with paypal or card?pay1ok, before i apply this, i do have to let you know that you are downgrading from a business plan, so you will not have certain features on the appsumo plan, like premium media, and limited to 10 min videospremium1You can make the transition to Russian, and then half Russian, half in English.Russian1i use it for my collage notes andcollage notes2your packing staff is unskilled , tomato, mausambi,podina, kadi patta, --20% is wasted.Mausambi,Podina,0would you mind sending over the workspace name or billing email address on file?workspace1workspace name is init.vc payment method ach or wire transfer billing email  your address llc iidf invest, llc iidf invest, myasnitskaya 13 str 18, russiaBilling1and your delivery timings is very long, and delayed.delivery Timings0the delivery guys are extremely pathetic also, it always going to raindelivery guys0however, i am still seeing the old workspace called gloo, which i should no longer be a part of.workspace0provide offers so that we can get attracted by your brandProvide offers0price and product availabilityPrice0i can do this on omnifocus, evernote, even things.OmniFocus,0it does not let me load a clip on the scenescene0this has all of them in one app.app.2hi, i have voice overs I would like to import and sync with scenes.sync1Airtable is an amazing app. My company is currently starting to implement this for product tracking and it is almost the perfect tool. I’ve rated the app 3 stars for 2 reasons:

No gallery view in app
-the ability to switch between views is the main reason we use Airtable instead of excel. Having an app version (that has a zoom option) would make this a 4 star app. 

No offline viewing mode
- the collaborative nature of this program is amazing. I realize solving discrepancies is the main reason for not having an offline mode. However, We use this mainly for a visual representation of our products. If we are in a building with bad signal or traveling overseas, it would be ideal to at least have a “last saved version” to reference photos offline. Offline viewing mode would make this a 5 star app.

I will immediately revise this review if gallery view is added to the app and if an offline viewing mode is added.

Everything requires numerous bolt on integrations that cost our company an extra $175/month. 

The Zapier integration helps a ton. However it’s missing several vital triggers. Like detecting an updated record. Thus the workaround is a $49/per month patch “plug in” by a 3rd party. 

Zapier claims they have been requesting this of Airtable to enable this for many many months. 

Come on Airtable. Please don’t make us pay hundreds of dollars more per month to enable features that Airtable could certainly provide. 

Another missing function (which would not require a zap), allowing customers to update their own record requires a 3rd party integration to simply create a unique url to a unique form for external updating.

Can't just add up a column without creating additional tables.   MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL TABLES.   And then the videos they have on their web site.    Seriously - how about a way of freezing the video so we can follow the steps.    Watched one video; I had to watch it 20 times at least so I could follow the steps.   

I know, it's not supposed to be excel.   I get it.   Still too complicated to just add up how much I am supposed to be reimbursed for my mileage, parking etc.

SMEAC
• Situation 
• Mission 
• Execution (of the mission, not your team… since no one would be left to make you coffee ☕️‼️)
• Administration 
• Communication 

I’m able to use exactly the same with Asana and get the same results in my business. Quickly, efficiently and as part of a team (without any blood stains or missing persons reporting).

I have 259 different apps between my iPhone and iPad. If I could only keep 3; 
• Notability
• Asana 
• My car key would be it (It would just be too expensive smashing the window every time I needed in the car).

I hope you guys have won awards! 🏆 You have certainly deserved it.

Bravo‼️

PS: I would recommend Asana for your business or if you need to organise your life. It’s worth every penny and it’s fairly good I suppose…Communication1can i start a free plan and then upgrade that to a business plan?plan1The iOS version is limited to only showing the simple row grid view you see in the screenshots — you can’t make or access a gallery view, a grid view row with a picture at the end, a Kanban board, etc.
